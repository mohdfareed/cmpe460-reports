\section*{Abstract}

This laboratory exercise involved the design and construction of a heartbeat detection circuit. For the detection of a heartbeat, a OPB745 reflective optical sensor can be used. This device will emit light through a finger and ideally measure reflected light which varies with the pulse within the arteries of a finger. The signal output is then filtered with a low pass filter and a high pass filter to exclude frequencies outside an expected range of heart rates. The resulting signal is then amplified by an op amp to get a more useable signal. This circuit was designed, simulated using LTspice, constructed on a breadboard, and measured. C code was written with an MSP432 microcontroller which would measure pulse based on the output of the constructed circuit. This exercise also includes the design of a PCB with the same heartbeat detection circuit. This exercise was partially successful since the circuit constructed behaved as expected with an oscilloscope generated sinusoidal signal. The circuit output was accurately used by the MSP432 to detect frequency in beats per minute. The circuit constructed was unable to detect a heartbeat using the OPB745 and the PCB was not designed.

\section*{Design Methodology}

A PPG is an instrument used to measure changes in blood volume under the skin. One use of this is to measure heart rate. A circuit was designed with the intent to measure pulse within a finger using a OPB745 reflective optical sensor.

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:ltspiceCompleteSchematic} shows the complete schematic designed. The 4N25 represents the OPB745. A 5V source is used to provide power to the OPB745, op amps, and a Schottky diode. Voltage division occurs between the 10k$\Omega$ rseistor and the photodetector. This signal then goes to voltage follower op amp which isolates the signal from the next stage. The signal is then filtered by a passive high pass RC filter. This filter has a cut off frequency of 0.7Hz which is 40bpm. The equation to for the high pass filter design is shown below.

\begin{equation}
R = \frac{1}{2*\pi*C*\text{f}_\text{c}} = \frac{1}{2*\pi*220nF*0.7Hz} = 1M\Omega \label{eq:HighPass}
\end{equation}

With a cut off frequency of 0.7Hz and a capacitor value of 220nF, \ref{eq:HighPass} shows that the appropriate resistor value is 1M$\Omega$. The signal from the high pass filter then goes through another voltage follower for isolation between stages. Next, the signal is filtered by a passive low pass RC filter. This filter has a cut off frequency of 3.5Hz which is 210bpm.  The equation to for the low pass filter design is shown below.

\begin{equation}
R = \frac{1}{2*\pi*C*\text{f}_\text{c}} = \frac{1}{2*\pi*220nF*3.5Hz} = 200k\Omega \label{eq:LowPass}
\end{equation}

With a cut off frequency of 3.5Hz and a capacitor value of 220nF, \ref{eq:LowPass} shows that the appropriate resistor value is 200k$\Omega$.

\section*{Results and Analysis}

The high-pass filter of the circuit was tested at different input frequencies and the resulting voltage gain and phase shift were plotted. Figure \ref{fig:highPassBode} shows the resulting Bode plot.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{high_pass_plot.pdf}
    \caption{High-Pass Filter Bode Plot}
    \label{fig:highPassBode}
\end{figure}

The figure shows that the calculated cutoff frequency of 0.7 Hz is approximately correct. The cutoff frequency on the plot is slightly higher than the calculated value, using -9 dB as the cutoff point (3 dB less than the maximum gain). The plot shows that the phase shift of the circuit is approximately 45 degrees at the cutoff frequency, decreasing to 0 degrees at higher frequencies. The phase shift has the general behavior of increasing from 75 to 0 degrees as the frequency increases.

The low-pass filter of the circuit was tested at different input frequencies and the resulting voltage gain and phase shift were plotted. Figure \ref{fig:lowPassBode} shows the resulting Bode plot.

    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{low_pass_plot.pdf}
    \caption{Low-Pass Filter Bode Plot}
    \label{fig:lowPassBode}
\end{figure}

The figure shows that the calculated cutoff frequency of 3.5 Hz is approximately correct. The cutoff frequency on the plot falls at the calculated value, using -3 dB as the cutoff point (3 dB less than the maximum gain). The phase shift of the circuit is approximately -38 degrees at the cutoff frequency, decreasing to -65 degrees at higher frequencies, which is the expected behavior. The phase shift has the general behavior of decreasing from 0 to -65 degrees as the frequency increases.

    \caption{Band-Pass Filter Bode Plot}
    \label{fig:bandPassBode}
\end{figure}

The figure shows that the calculated cutoff frequencies of 0.7 Hz and 3.5 Hz are approximately correct. Using -11 dB as the cutoff point (3 dB less than the maximum gain), the lower cutoff frequency is slightly lower than the calculated value and the upper cutoff frequency is slightly higher than the calculated value. The phase shift of the circuit is approximately 30 degrees at the lower cutoff frequency, decreasing to -25 degrees at the upper cutoff frequency, which is the expected behavior. The phase shift has the general behavior of decreasing from 60 to -65 degrees as the frequency increases.

\section*{Questions}

\textbf{1.} \emph{What is the ERC and DRC for?}

ERC stands for Electrical Rule Check and DRC stands for Design Rule Check. The ERC checks for electrical errors in the schematic, such as unconnected pins. The DRC checks for design errors in the schematic, such as incorrect pin types.
